__init__.py — an empty file created here so that Django/Python will recognise the folder 
as a Python Package and allow you to use its objects within other parts of the project.

A migrations folder, used to store "migrations" 
— files that allow you to automatically update your database as you modify your models. 

For the Local Library website the website folder and its project folder will be named locallibrary, 
and we'll have just one application named catalog. The top level folder structure will therefore be as follows:

locallibrary/         # Website folder
    manage.py         # Script to run Django tools for this project (created using django-admin)
    locallibrary/     # Website/project folder (created using django-admin)
    catalog/          # Application folder (created using manage.py)
